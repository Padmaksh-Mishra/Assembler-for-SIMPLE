When emu will come to the branch or call lines it will see last 24 bits as the offset for the pc.
Thus the offset should be made set in assembler itself as Current_PC-Label_PC 
While execution of EMU the program will rewind the lines by value(last 24)/4 

ASSEMBLER:
    SET and DATA is left to implement 
    lines like "label:inst op" are dangerous
    data and set will function similarly to me
EMU:
    It will read the list of instructions 
    Stack and stack pointer will be also there
    Kitna rewind karna hai wo bhi branch or call ke operands bata denge

    RETRUN: it will take the pc to the value stored in A to the PC kind of it will rewind the line --- The value in here was stored by CALL.
    afik if no return the program will continue into another label;
